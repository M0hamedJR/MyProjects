## Instructions
I read Project instructions in udacity classroom.


## methods and properties that I used according to what I've been learnd :
- .addEventListener()
- document.querySelectorAll() 
- document.querySelector() 
- .creatElement()
- .appendChild ()
- .innerHTML property
- .classList()

## websites I used to to get ideas:

- W3schools 
- MDN (to read about getBoundingClientRec() method )

### Also I watch some videos to get ideas
## I made all requirements again,but I can't add active class on one link so if you can pass this please do , I don't have enough time. 

## look at the console to see the time of the code takes. 

#### this is my frist Project inmy life ,so please take that into consideration.
